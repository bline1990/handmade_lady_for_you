  "donations_intro": "Over the years, I have supported several Croatian shelters with small gestures – donating bows and scarves I made with love, and I wish to continue helping. Every bow or scarf is not just a fashion accessory, but a small contribution to a big change in the lives of animals waiting for their chance at happiness and a forever home. Our mission is simple: every dog deserves love, care, and a chance for a home. Bows help in photoshoots, attract attention, and give dogs extra charm — and believe me, it makes a difference. Bows are not just a symbol of style, but a symbol of hope. When a dog shines in a photo, it's easier to find its way into someone's heart and home.",
