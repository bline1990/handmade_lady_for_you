    "heroTitle": "When love for dogs becomes inspiration for creation",
    "heroText": "It all started with a great love for my cavalier Lady. I enjoyed photographing her, filming her, and sharing her everyday adventures so much that I opened her own Instagram profile in 2022. Through this adventure, I met a wonderful community of cavalier king charles spaniel owners across Europe and the world, and from numerous online acquaintances, real friendships were born. Over time, Lady became a little fashion influencer. Inspired by the beautiful dog accessories that are made all over the world — especially bows, scarves, and rubber bands, which are still rarely seen in Croatia — I wanted to bring exactly such products here. I spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning sewing techniques, but also working with hot glue and a gun, and all the little tricks that help make every detail neat, sturdy, and aesthetically flawless. At the same time, I researched where to get quality materials and modern, trendy patterns. After investing in equipment, I completely surrendered to the creative process — and fell in love with it.",
    "story1Title": "The story that started it all",
    "story1Text": "I was especially pleased to see dogs wearing something I had made with my own hands, with a lot of care and love. I also donated a large part of the bows to our shelters, so that their residents could also shine in something new and beautiful — you can read more about that in the Donations section. During that period, a friend made me a logo inspired by Lady, as the name suggests — ladyforyou.",
    "story2Title": "Over time, our little family grew",
    "story2Text": "Another cavalier has joined us — Story. Today, we are a true trio that brings joy, inspiration, and new ideas to everything we create every day. I make each product with love and a desire to make your pet look and feel special."

    "intro1": "It is my greatest joy today to have so many different dog models around the world – from America and Australia to Europe and my Croatia – proudly wearing my work. Every time I see a photo of a dog in one of my products, I feel happy and motivated to continue. That’s why I create each piece individually, with care and understanding that no dog or owner is the same. Each has their wishes, sizes, and little details, and I’m here to listen and fulfill them.",
    "intro2": "I always strive to give my best so that every product is as beautiful, comfortable, and perfectly fitted as possible, and I gladly provide advice about the ideal size or choice of details.",
    "intro3": "Although my first clients were mostly foreigners who discovered me through the blog @lady_the_cav_dog with over 11k followers, today we are slowly expanding in Croatia, where I happily offer something different. For my creations, I opened a special Instagram profile @handmade_by_ladyforyou with over 1000 fans of fashion accessories for pets.",
    "intro4": "And my biggest inspiration in all this are my two Cavaliers, who encourage me to create every day."

Every bow or scarf is not just a fashion detail, but a small contribution to big changes in the lives of animals waiting for their chance at happiness and a forever home. Our mission is simple: every dog deserves love, attention, and a chance for a home. Bows help in photographing, attract attention, and give dogs an extra dose of charm — and believe me, it makes a difference. Bows are not just a symbol of style, but a symbol of hope. When a dog shines in a photo, it is easier to find its way to someone's heart and home."
